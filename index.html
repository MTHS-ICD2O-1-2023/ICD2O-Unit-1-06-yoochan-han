        Scientific name: Linepithema-crassus
        Hoarding bugs (of the order Hymenoptera) are large, social insects. While often found living alone, they have been found
        to share their nests with members of their own species. They measure a height of 3 feet on average, with bulbous bodies.
        The thinness of their fluid and blood and the material of their carapaces contributes to their low weight, making them
        capable of flight with their membranous wings. It also makes their bodies somewhat transparent.
        Hoarding bugs were given their name due to their territorial nature. Once they have chosen a place as their nest, they
        will seek to adorn it with any object they can find and will protect these objects as a part of the nest. Hoarding bugs
        are not so dangerous alone as they are in large hives. However, if left alone, hoarding bugs are surprisingly neutral
        and pose little danger. wWe love the stupid cuddle bugs.!! - tjhis has been a note from the indomitable Sigurd</p>
